    <h2>Andrew Palmer</h2>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>My name is Andrew Palmer. I'm a devoted father of four, with a caring and supportive wife who has been a blessing in my life ever since the day we met. Together, we own our own media company, PBC Multi Media, specializing in local search through a variety of mediums. Having grown up in the church, I'm about to embrace a new role, that of Bishop, to be sustained this coming Sunday.</p>
    <h3>Dad</h3>
    <p>During a recent Christmas family gathering, my mom thought it would be funny to put my brother and I in the spotlight by having us and our better haves compete in a time-honored game of 'Newlywed'. At one point, Collette (my wife) and I were each asked the same question: "what do you think (Andrew's) favorite trait is about himself?" After some thought, we each answered in unison 'being a dad.'
    I love spending time with my kids! We enjoy boardgames, movies, sports, ministering, dancing, sledding - pretty much everything. They keep me up at night, and they keep me young at heart.

    <h3>Church</h3>
    <p>I find service in the church to be very rewarding - and exciting. To me, there's so much opportunity in the world to share the gospel, organize and grow the kingdom, and lift people's burdens by directing them to Jesus Christ. I love him very much, and feel immense gratitude for all he does for myself and my family.</p>
